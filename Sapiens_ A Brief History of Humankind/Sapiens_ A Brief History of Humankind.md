## What's So Good About Men?

> At least since the Agricultural Revolution, most human societies have been patriarchal societies that valued men more highly than women.

- **Patriarchal society**: Patriarchal contains the root **patr(pater)** which means "father". And **matr(mater)** means "mother", thus **matriarch** is the opposite of **patriarch** , which is the society controlled by women. [MATR_and_PATR](https://github.com/MichaelEcon/English/blob/main/Merriam-Webster's_Vocabulary_Builder/MATR_and_PATR.md)
- If we think about this phenomenon, we may think that because men are good at agricultural production, they are valued higher than women. But Yuvoal discuss later that there are large number theory try to interpret this phenomenon, but they are both have some problems. It is surprising and interesting, right?

> Patriarchal societies educate men to think and act in a masculine way and women to think and act in a feminine way, punishing anyone who dares cross those boundaries. Yet they do not equally reward those who conform.

- **masculine** -- **feminine**
- The reward is not equal.

> Patriarchy has been the norm in almost all agricultural and industrial societies. Egypt, for example, was conquered numerous times over the centuries. Assyrians, Persians, Macedonians, Romans, Arabs, Mameluks, Turks and British occupied it – and its society always remained patriarchal. Egypt was governed by Pharaonic law, Greek law, Roman law, Muslim law, Ottoman law and British law – and they all discriminated against people who were not 'real men'.
> **Since patriarchy is so universal, it cannot be the product of some vicious circle that was kick-started by a chance occurrence.** It is particularly noteworthy that even before 1492, most societies in both America and Afro-Asia were patriarchal, even though they had been out of contact for thousands of years. If patriarchy in Afro-Asia resulted from some chance occurrence, why were the Aztecs and Incas patriarchal? It is far more likely that even though the precise definition of ‘man’ and ‘woman’ varies between cultures, there is some universal biological reason why almost all cultures valued manhood over womanhood. **We do not know what this reason is. There are plenty of theories, none of them convincing.**
